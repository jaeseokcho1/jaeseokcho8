I am a PhD Candidate in International Relations at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

I am interested in civil wars, international conflicts, and international institutions, with a focus on factors related to civil war recurrence. I am currently working on a project that explores the relationship between granting amnesty and the durability of civil war power-sharing agreements. 

In addition to the topics mentioned above, I am also interested in data generated from social networks. My other current project examines the relationship between individualsâ€™ Twitter usage and their political ideology using Congressional Twitter data.
